This software was developed for the [ROADEF/EURO Challenge 2012](http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/en/index.php). The challenge, proposed by Google, consists in the optimization a data center by reassigning processes to different machines. A joint load-cost, movement-cost and balance-cost metric has to be minimized subject to capacity, dependency, availability and continuity constraints. The complete problem description is available  [here](http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/files/problem_definition_v1.pdf).

Our team (J33) won the **third prize in the junior category**. We also ended up 4th in the open-source category and 6th in the overall ranking. The code is written in C++11 and distributed under the GPL v2 license. The final results are available [here](http://challenge.roadef.org/2012/files/Roadef%20-%20results.pdf).
